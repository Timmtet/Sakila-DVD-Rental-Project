This project the Sakila DVD Rental database was queried. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. This database was queried to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. 

The ERD diagram for the project is in the 'dvd-rental-erd-2' file while the project solutions are the sql files and the project visualization file.

Here's the lin to the Sakila DVD Rental Database:
